## Open Subtitles
One of the primary sources for content was [Open Subtitles](http://www.opensubtitles.org/en). For this project, I conducted an "advanced search" with the following selections: (1) Search Only in Movies, (2) Movie Language = Korean, (3) Movie Country = South Korea, (4) Format = srt, (5) Movie Year >= 2000. I only used movies since 2000 since I wanted the results to be representative of modern language.
